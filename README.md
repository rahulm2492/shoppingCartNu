React-Redux

Run Server : node server(api based on user input , for now everthing in the form is acceptable)

Run UI - npm run dev (webpack server will run)

Run build (npm run build) , it will helps us to host the app on any third party platform with minimum configuration.


Unit Test Cases Coming Soon....
